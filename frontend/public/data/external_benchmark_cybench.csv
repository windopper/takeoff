† The scores for OpenAI o3-mini and OpenAI o1-mini are inflated because HAL likely ran on a fork of the Inspect framework that leaked the answer to a task that both models completed successfully. Their Unguided % Solved scores have been adjusted downward by 2.5% (to 22.5% and 10% respectively) and their FSTs have been updated to reflect their most difficult tasks solved excluding the leaked task (42 min for o3-mini and 11 min for o1-mini).""
